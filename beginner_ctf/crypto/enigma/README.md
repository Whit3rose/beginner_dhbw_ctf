The following string is given:  
vcpb{qcjbgonp_vol_uhujp_vjan_kajzrn}  
It already looks a lot like a flag. However the trype of encryption is unknown.  

However there is also a file with the following content:  
UKW	6F	5E  
I	1A	14N  
II	21U	1A  
III	14N	14N  

The name of this file is ArthurScherbius.txt -> research reveals, that he is the inventor of the enigma machine  
A little bit of research shows that the enigma setup looks really similar. With the help of a website like cryptii.com (https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine), we can brute force the missing pieces
