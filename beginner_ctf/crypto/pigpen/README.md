This challenge is kind of weird. All we get is an image of some strange symbols.  
![pigpen](/images/pigpen.png?raw=true "pigpen")  
All we have to do to get the flag is to figure out what the symbols mean. After some research, you might find that these are part of a pigpen encryption. As soon as we get that information, we can easily use maps that translate the symbols to letters (like this one: https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/pigpen-cipher.html) and get the flag:
