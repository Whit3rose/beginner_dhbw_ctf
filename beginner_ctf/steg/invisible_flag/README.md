This time, we receive a .png file where the content indicates, that the flag should be displayed in the image but does not get shown. By using stegsolve to apply different filters, or by writing a simple script to increase the brightness level for the relevant pixels we can at some point read the flag:  
![stegsolve](/images/stegsolve.png?raw=true "stegsolve")  
![stegsolve](/images/stegsolve2.png?raw=true "stegsolve")
