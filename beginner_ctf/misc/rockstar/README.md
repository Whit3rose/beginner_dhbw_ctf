In the challenge, we are provided a simple code.txt file that saves something what looks like a poem or lyrics to a song. The interesting part of this challenge is to search for whatever this could mean. If we look up, what code could be written in a song, at some point we get introduced to the rockstar programming language:  
https://codewithrockstar.com/  
Fortunatly, this website also has the capability to execute our code:  
![rockstar](/images/rockstar.png?raw=true "rockstar")  
The output are some integers that might be simply ascii representations. Trying that gives us the string ROCK_YOU that we can put in the flag format:  
dhbw{ROCK_YOU}
