In this challenge, what we get is a textfile that shoes the original values of an email. There is a lot of information in it but the interesting part seems to be in the end of the file:  
![email](/images/email.png?raw=true "email")  
This states that there was a pdf attachement. The file itself also seems part of the textfile we got. However it seems to be in base64 format. We can use online tools to decode this and get back the original pdf file:
